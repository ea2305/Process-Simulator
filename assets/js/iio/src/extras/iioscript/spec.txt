iio script specification
========================
v 1.0

Syntax

	iio script is a series of statements, which can be
	composed of one or more expressions.

	An expression can be a:

		definition
		assignment
		function call
		core function call
		conditional
		loop

	expressions are composed of:

		keywords
		variables
		operators
		values

	whitespace is used to delineate expressions, statements,
	keywords, functions, and values.

Defnitions

	named variables are created using the 'var' keyword.

	variable definition:

		var i = value

Assignments

	values are assigned using the '=' operator.

	variable assignment:

		i = value

	variable definition and assignment:

		var i = value

Functions

	functions are variables that can be defined with
	the 'fn' keyword. The 'end' keyword is required
	at the end of the function body.

	function definition:

		var myFunction = fn(params...)
			...
		end

	ordered parameters may be defined within trailing
	parentheses. Whitespace is used to delineate parameters.

	function with parameters definition:

		var myFunction = fn( arg0 arg1 ... )
			...
		end


Function Calls

	functions are called by adding a training parentheses to
	the function name.

	function call:

		myFunction()

	function call with parameters:

		myFunction( arg0 arg1 ... )

	function call with named parameters:

		myFunction( arg0: a0 arg1: a1)


Core Function Calls

	core functions are called by adding the function keyword,
	a set of named parameters, and an 'end' keyword

	core function call:

		set
			property value 
			...
		end

	core functions:

		new
		add
		set

Conditionals

	conditional blocks are created using the following syntax:

	if boolean_value
		...
	else if boolean_value
		...
	else
		...
	end

Loops

	looping blocks are created using the following syntax:

	for var = range [by step]
		...
	end

	OR

	while boolean_value
		...
	end

Ranges
	
	ranges are defined with two values seperated by a 'to' keyword:

		0 to 100

	ranges can be used in loop definitions or random function calls.

Shapes

	shapes are created with the 'new' or 'add' keyword followed by
	a set of properties and the 'end' keyword

	var myShape = new 
		type circle
		size 40
		...
	end

	add
		type square
		size 40
	end

	shape properties
		type
		vs
		pos 		x : y : z
		vel 		x : y
		acc			x : y
		width
		height
		lineWidth
		color
		alpha
		shrink

	some shapes have additional properties:

	grid properties
		R
		C
		res

	text properties
		font
		text
		align
